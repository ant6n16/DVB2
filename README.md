# DVB2

This repository contains the archives created for a project of the subject of Digital Electronics for Communications of the master in Telecommunications Engineering.
The objective is to develop a program in MATLAB that is in charge of simulating the transmission based on OFDM that is carried out in the transmission of DTT channels. This communication is based on the DVB standard. 
The entire program has been developed according to that standard. Communication can be configured in two modes (2K or 8K) and with several different constellations (BPSK, QPSK, QAM). The P1 + AWGN channel has also been modeled to simulate the actual transmission of the data. Both equalization and dmap have been implemented in the receiver. The program ends by calculating the BER
